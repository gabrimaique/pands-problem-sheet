### Weekly Task 02 bmy.py

#### Task Description:

#### Write a program that calculates somebody's body mass index (BMI)

#### Explaining:
#### This program calculates a person's Body Mass Index. The user will first be asked to enter their weight in kilograms, after they have to insert their height in centmetres. We use the Float method to convert string to float. The formula to calculate the BMI is BMI = kg/m2 . Than the output is printed.

### Weekly Task 03 secondstring.py

#### Task Description:
#### Write a program that asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order.

#### Explaining:
#### First we ask the user to input a sentence to creat a string. Each character in a string has a corresponding numerical value. To reverse a string in python we have to use a slice function. In order to move two steps backward we used the slice statement [::-2] that shows the full string every second value backwards and prints out these characters. The start and end point are left blank to include the entire string.

### Weekly Task 04 collatz.py

#### Task Description:
#### Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.

#### Explaining: 
#### The user is asked to input a positive integer. Then a list [] is used to store multiple items in a single variable. The script uses a while statement, that execute the code as long as the while statement's condition is true, to check if the number is not 1.  We use the if statement to verify if the number is odd or even. If its greater than 1 the output will be added to the list (mylist.append(number)) and will be used as the input for the next run of the code.
